\section{Summary}  I am a software developer passionate about low-level who enjoys to understand how the machine really works. I am interested mainly in C, Go, assembly, embedded systems, Linux kernel and Plan9 operating system. I like to understand the definitions, standards and concepts before applying them and I take simplicity as lifestyle and coding philosophy.

I have dedicated many years of my life to computer security, more precisely malware analysis in UNIX-like environmnet. I developed an opensource project entitled malELFicus, which is a library and a toolkit to analyse and infect ELF binaries. 

As entrepreneur I founded SEC+, a company focused in computer security consultancy, where our main tasks were pentest development, codereview and coaching.

Currently I'm working as a team leader at Neoway, and I've been coaching other developers, guiding, researching and defining technologies. I'm the developer leader of the Neosearch, a library and service to full text search engine written in Go.

I'm also  very keen of functional programming, particularly Lisp and Scheme.. I've also worked with Java, Python, JavaScript, PHP, Lua and C++. Apart from my technical skills, I'm a commited professional, with can-do attitude, extremely motivated and someone who enjoys sharing knowledge.

  Technical consultant of many product's architecture. Team leader and engineer of a high performance maps software, using a micro-service architecture for store, normalize and process spatial operations.
This software was developed with simplicity in mind and loosely coupled modules/services. Automatic deploy in Amazon AWS using technologies like CoreOS, Docker and Kubernetes.
    In the meanwhile I started an opensource library and server for full text search called NeoSearch. The project is designed from the ground up to solve very specific search engine problems of Neoway related to fast JOIN operations between datasets and make the process of data modeling changes more easy.

        I was CEO and had worked as IT security consultant, performing penetration tests, code review and coaching. At the same time, I’d started the project malelficus for malware analysis and study of ELF infection methods in unix-like environments. The whole project was written in C. Moreover, I lectured about it in the following events: H2HC (Hackers to Hackers Conference), FISL (International Forum of Free Software), OWASP Floripa Day and others.
